The MongoDB database is hosted on Microsoft Azure which is scalable.  

The application uses Azure to auto-scale and provide quality reliable hosting.   
We Are Using Customer's Locationa as a starting point, and taking his parking choice from his click, and after that we employ the GeoApi of MapmyIndia to find out the coordinates and hence generate the route b/w the 2 points. We have created an interface for the parking operators which facilitated the registration of their parking space on our wesbite, where they can manage real-time occupation of parking space.   

It also helps the client (user) to find the nearest parking lot
